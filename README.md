- Then rename the folder to th06
- Move that folder into `src/mountPoint`


## Operating Instructions

### Running the simulation

### Showing the Replay

## The Outline

This is a project to try to get Machine leaning to play one of the touhou games (a bullet hell). This should be relatively simple because you don't need any off screen information.

## The Architecture
- Docker Ubuntu Container
  - Touhou Game 
    - (Optionally) Runs as a headless process (no window)
    - Window is stored in a buffer
  - Rust Program
    - loads Model from mounted folder (If available)
    - Accesses Touhou window
    - Gives window key presses
    - Tells the game to save all of the runs (Touhou has this functionality built in)
    - On Shutdown Saves model to mounted folder
  - Save Script
    - Upon a replay being saved move it from the image to a mounted folder
